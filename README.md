# Hotel search engine

This is a RESTful web application that can help you plan your trips!  
You can search for hotels and it will bring you to the Expedia page of the hotel.  
It also supports the history and favorite feature, where history stores all the hotel pages you go to, and favorite allows you to save the hotels you like.  
With the login/sign-up feature, users have their profiles saved in the database using MySQL.
